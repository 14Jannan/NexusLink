NexusLink is a dynamic web platform designed to foster a vibrant community connecting job seekers, innovative startup ideas, and companies looking to hire talent. It serves as a central hub where aspiring professionals can discover opportunities, entrepreneurs can showcase their ventures, and businesses can find the right candidates.

This project was developed as part of a competition organized by WSO2, demonstrating a full-stack application leveraging modern web technologies.

## Features

*   **Job Board:** Connect job seekers with open positions from various companies.
*   **Startup Showcase:** Provide a platform for showcasing new startup ideas.
*   **Company Profiles:** Allow companies to list their details and hiring needs.
*   **User Interaction:** Enable interaction between job seekers, startups, and companies.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Backend:** Ballerina

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run NexusLink on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js & npm:** Required for the React frontend. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Ballerina:** Required for the Ballerina backend. Follow the installation guide on [ballerina.io](https://ballerina.io/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexuslink.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd nexuslink
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup:**

    Navigate to the frontend directory (e.g., `frontend/` or `client/` depending on your project structure) and install the necessary Node modules.

    ```bash
    cd [frontend-directory-name] # e.g., cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup:**

    Navigate to the backend directory (e.g., `backend/` or `server/` depending on your project structure). Ballerina projects typically don't require a separate `install` step beyond having Ballerina installed.

    ```bash
    cd [backend-directory-name] # e.g., cd backend
    ```

### Running the Application

Once both the frontend and backend are set up, you can run the application.

1.  **Start the Backend:**

    From the backend directory, execute the Ballerina run command.

    ```bash
    bal run
    ```
    This will start the Ballerina backend server, typically on a port like `9090`.

2.  **Start the Frontend:**

    From the frontend directory, start the React development server.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will open the NexusLink frontend in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## About the Competition

NexusLink was developed as part of a competition organized by WSO2, showcasing the capabilities of Ballerina for backend development and React for building interactive user interfaces.
